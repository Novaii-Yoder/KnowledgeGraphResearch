This repo contains a demo jupyter notebook file demonstrating the project I built and worked on for Master's Project for NMSU in 2024.

The demo shows my work on 3 main parts of a complete system to improve knowledge context and tracibility within GPTs. First, a knowledge graph is to be created from the texts provided to capture their content, entities, and relationships between these entities. Second, we can traverse this graph using embeddings, and find the most related entities and document to our current query. These related documents and entities can be used to improve the context of the OpenAI request, creating improved answers without retraining the GPT. Third, we can use the answer generated and the query to find two points in the graph that best fit. Using proven graph path finding methods we can then find a 'path of reasoning' between the query and answer. This path will be a representation of the logical steps take to get from the query to the answer, while not proven to be the most correct or valid reasoning, it does offer a way for the user to verify and examine in more detail weather or not to accept the answer as true.

# Requirements
To run the code you will need all the *.py files in the repo, jupyter notebook, and python installed. It will also require a service account key to OpenAI, the location of which can be changed in the jupyter notebook, to work.
